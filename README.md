## Project 2

## 1 Implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm for path planning of a point robot

## GitHub link: https://github.com/Satish-Vennapu/Dijkstra-algorithm-implementation.git

**filename: Dijkstra_Satish_Vennapu.py**

for running the code

**Requirements:**
1. python 
2. opencv
3. numpy
4. heapq
5. time



### Note: 
**The outer boundaries and the obstacles are bloated by clearance of 5 on all sides.**


### Test case1:
        Enter the X Co-ordinate of the start node: 10
        Enter the Y Co-ordinate of the start node: 10
        Enter the X Co-ordinate of the goal node: 50
        Enter the Y Co-ordinate of the goal node: 50
        Reached the goal node and Starting Back Tracking
        Total time for Code Execution:  61.81502389907837

### Test case2:
        Enter the X Co-ordinate of the start node: 10
        Enter the Y Co-ordinate of the start node: 10
        Enter the X Co-ordinate of the goal node: 90
        Enter the Y Co-ordinate of the goal node: 90
        Reached the goal node and Starting Back Tracking
        Total time for Code Execution:  182.94583439826965

### Test case3: testing for goal node in obstacle space
        Enter the X Co-ordinate of the start node: 40
        Enter the Y Co-ordinate of the start node: 45
        Enter the X Co-ordinate of the goal node: 100
        Enter the Y Co-ordinate of the goal node: 85
        The given goal node is in the obstacle space
